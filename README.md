# Close Any Bracket

A minimalist extension adding one command:

- `Close last open (, [, or {` which closes the last open parenthesis, brace, or bracket. (default shortcut `Alt+]`, Mac: `Control+]`)


## Limitations

Does not understand any syntax except for brackets, and will happily close brackets that are e.g. within strings.
